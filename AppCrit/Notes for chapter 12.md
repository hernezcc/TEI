## 12.2 Linking the Apparatus to the Text
There are two ways an apparatus can be represented in TEI: inline or standoff. The inline method, also known as "parallel segmentation" relies on noting variants at the locations where they occur in the base text.
* disagree emphatically with the assertion that parallel segmentation doesn't use a base text. You could theoretically construct one without a base text, where every word was inside an app, but anything in the text not inside an app *is* part of the base text.
* propose to quietly deprecate the "location referenced" method. That doesn't necessarily entail disposing of @loc.
